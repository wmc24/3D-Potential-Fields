# 3D-Potential-Fields
This project builds upon your work on potential fields from Assignment 2. The goal of this
project is to improve upon the potential fields you implemented in the assignment and generalize them to 3D space. The scenario is a homogeneous group of spaceships navigating in
space, moving between planets to move resources. The spaceships have to avoid collisions with
other spaceships, planets, and fast-moving meteoroids. You can start by implementing a 2D
environment to debug and improve your solution and then generalize it to a 3D environment.
We are not interested in 3D renderings but rather in the high-level 3D navigation objective.
Extensions: Use the implemented 3D potential field to train a neural network that imitates
the velocity vectors of the potential field locally for each agent.
